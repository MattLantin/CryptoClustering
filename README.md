# Cryptocurrency Analysis: Clustering and PCA

## Introduction
This project employs unsupervised learning methods, specifically K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to investigate the impact of 24-hour and 7-day price fluctuations on cryptocurrencies. The findings reveal that cryptocurrencies categorize into four distinct clusters. These clusters are further refined using PCA for deeper insights.
